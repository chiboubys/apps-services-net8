# Apps and Services with .NET 8, Second Edition

Repository for the Packt Publishing book titled "Apps and Services with .NET 8" by Mark J. Price

This book is expected to publish on Tuesday, December 5, 2023.

My author page on Amazon: https://www.amazon.com/Mark-J-Price/e/B071DW3QGN/ 

All of my books on my publisher Packt's website: https://subscription.packtpub.com/search?query=mark+j.+price

## Code solutions for Visual Studio 2022 and Visual Studio Code

If you have Visual Studio 2022 and Visual Studio Code and its C# extension installed on the same computer, the build process can sometimes conflict. This is because Visual Studio has its own non-standard build server that is different from the standard build server used by .NET SDK. Visual Studio 2022 and Visual Studio Code also use different file types to group projects. So I have duplicated and separated solution code for each product:

- [/vs](/vs): Visual Studio 2022 for Windows or Mac solution files and projects for each chapter.
- [/vscode](/vscode): Visual Studio Code workspace files and projects for each chapter.

## Microsoft Certifications
Microsoft used to have exams and certifications for developers that covered skills like C# and ASP.NET. Sadly, they have retired them all. These days, the only developer-adjacent exams and certifications are for Azure or Power Platform, as you can see from the certification poster: https://aka.ms/traincertposter
