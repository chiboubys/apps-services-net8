# Information for Technical Reviewers

If you are a Technical Reviewer for this book, then you will find useful information on this page.

## Installing previews

Microsoft releases official previews of .NET 8 on [Patch Tuesday](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patch_Tuesday) each month or one week later. I maintain a list of [.NET 8 preview releases](https://github.com/markjprice/cs11dotnet7/blob/main/docs/dotnet8.md).

## Word files

I will add a comment to the top of each Word document for a chapter that specifies the version of .NET 8 preview that I used. You can either use exactly the same version or a newer version but be aware that there may be differences in behavior. These differences could be temporary (new bugs are sometimes added and later removed) or permanent so it is always useful to add a comment about any unexpected behavior that you experience. 

## Operating systems and code editors

Inevitably there will be differences in .NET on different operating systems. Historically about 70% of readers use Visual Studio 2022 on Windows so that is the primary code editor and OS that I use while writing preliminary drafts (PDs) during May to July. I often do not test on macOS with Visual Studio Code until final drafts (FDs) in September. I may not test on Linux at all, so if you're willing to, that'd be awesome!
